IF YOU RESTART YOUR COMPUTER THEN

To get back to your WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) Ubuntu environment and start Redis after restarting your computer, follow these steps:

### 1. Open WSL (Ubuntu)
- Press **Windows key** and type "WSL" or "Ubuntu".
- Click on the **Ubuntu** app to open your Linux terminal.

### 2. Start Redis Server
Once you're in the WSL terminal, you can start the Redis server by running:

```bash
sudo service redis-server start
```

### 3. Access Redis CLI
After starting the Redis server, you can access the Redis CLI by running:

```bash
redis-cli
```

This will connect you to the local Redis instance running on your machine (`127.0.0.1:6379`).

### 4. Connect to a Remote Redis Instance
If you want to connect to a remote Redis instance, use the same command as before from the **Ubuntu shell**, not inside the Redis CLI:

```bash
redis-cli -u redis://default:mrlrNaemFhBAN3xMXA43MeIQ7tCscvUk@redis-10451.c264.ap-south-1-1.ec2.redns.redis-cloud.com:10451
```

This will allow you to connect to your remote Redis server.
By following these steps after a reboot, you'll be back to your Redis environment in no time.
